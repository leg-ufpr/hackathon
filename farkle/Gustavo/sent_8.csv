In the stations and centers of life the professional pushes you three liters, that is to sell. see your manual that without the filter is 2,2l and with a 2,7l filter.

In addition to being poorly treated, I think I have paid dearly for scheduled maintenance. In the 18-month review, the full budget was just over R1500, and the car had less than 18,000 KM wheels: absurd. At the time, I only changed the oils and filters, that alone cost almost R400 and dispense the other services. Part of this budget was related to minor problems in the car, such as door and steering noises and, as the car was no longer in the warranty, I left unadjusted. Mainly for this reason, I do not buy more VW cars. In the future I will get cars with 3 year warranty, like the Renaults.

Incidentally .. the sensor display already gave problem, I will have to go there to make the exchange of it.
